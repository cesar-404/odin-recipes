        This potion is revered by those seeking a luxurious mane, but beware: it 
        has been known to take a rather <em>literal</em> interpretation of growth. Brew at your own risk!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Rapunzel's Root</strong> (only use the glowing part, lest you risk an unwanted curse)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pins' Hair Strands</strong> (the kind that fall from the deepest corners of 
            your drawer, the strongest variety)
        </li>
        <li>
            D<strong>ew Drops from the High Peaks</strong> (collected on a particularly windy morning)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A Pinch of Phoenix Feather Dust</strong> (hard to acquire, but makes 
            everything far more interesting)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Laughter Tears from a Court Jester</strong> (find the best giggle you can)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Instructions:
        </strong>
    </p>   
        <ol>
            <li>
                Grind the Rapunzel's Root together with the Pins' Hair Strands
                until you have a thick, creamy paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the Dew Drops from the High Peaks while telling your best joke. 
                If no one laughs, you might find your own tears replacing the dewdrops.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the mixture with the Phoenix Feather Dust and finish with 
                the Laughter Tears.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drink the potion quickly. If all goes well, your hair will grow 
                thicker and stronger than ever. If not, your feet may start to 
                grow in proportion. In that case, be prepared for big shoes and 
                even bigger stage performances.
            </li>
        </ol>
