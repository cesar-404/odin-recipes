    <p>
        This peculiar potion is said to enhance the vocal cords, making one 
        sound like a nightingaleâ€”or at least, a moremelodious snorer. For those 
        seeking vocal prowess or a reputation for unique night-time noises.
    </p>

        <strong>
            Ingredients:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Bored Mermaid Tears</strong> (known for their gentle, melodic underwater hum)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dust of Falling Stars</strong> (extremely difficult to capture, but totally worth the effort)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Nighttime Raven Songs</strong> (ravens have a peculiar vocal technique, so capture an authentic sound)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A Leaf from the Confused Moss</strong> (found in a field full of indecisive squirrels)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Instructions:
        </strong>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour the Bored Mermaid Tears into a chalice and add the Dust of 
            Falling Stars, stirring slowly while humming a thunderous tune.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the Nighttime Raven Songs to the mix and wait for the sound to 
            turn slightly off-key (this is actually a good sign).
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, drop the Leaf of Confused Moss into the potion. If your voice 
            starts to harmonize like a celestial choir, you've succeeded. If not, 
            prepare to be renowned for your epic snoring skills.
        </li>
    </ol>
